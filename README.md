# Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) Workshop

## Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook and accompanying code designed for a high school educational workshop on the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). The workshop targets students in grades 11-12 and aims to provide a hands-on learning experience in astronomy and data analysis.

## Educational Goals

- **Understanding the CMB**: Explain the Cosmic Microwave Background and its significance in cosmology.
- **Formation of the CMB**: Describe how the CMB was formed and its connection to the Big Bang.
- **Physics Concepts**: Introduce Planck's Law, Wien's Law, and black body radiation graphs.
- **Astronomical Phenomena**: Explore the Doppler effect and redshift.
- **Data Analysis**: Analyze real CMB data, identify features, and measure the angular size of hot spots.
- **Programming Skills**: Improve Python programming skills through optional exercises and interactive tools.
- **Cosmological Constants**: Understand the Hubble Constant ($H_0$) and its impact on the estimated age of the universe.

## Repository Structure

- **Notebook**: The main Jupyter notebook (`notebook.ipynb`) guides students through the activities and concepts.
- **cmb**: Custom Python module containing functions for data extraction, visualization, and analysis of CMB data.
- **Content**: Educational content is provided in Canadian English, but can be translated into other languages as needed.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/louisbranch/cmb_workshop.git
