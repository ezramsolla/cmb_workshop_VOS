## Introduction

### The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)

The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) is the afterglow of the Big Bang, the event that created our universe around 13.8 billion years ago. This faint glow fills the entire sky and is one of the most important pieces of evidence for the Big Bang theory.

#### What is the CMB?

The CMB is a form of electromagnetic radiation (EM radiation), similar to visible light but in the microwave part of the spectrum. EM radiation encompasses all forms of light, from radio waves to gamma rays, differing in wavelength and frequency. Here's a simplified explanation:

- **Wavelength and Frequency:** EM radiation behaves like waves. Wavelength is the distance between wave crests, while frequency measures how often these waves pass a given point.

- **The Electromagnetic Spectrum:** This spectrum spans from long-wavelength radio waves to short-wavelength gamma rays, with visible light occupying a small segment in the middle.

#### Formation of the CMB

In the early universe, everything was so hot that atoms couldn't form; protons and electrons were separate particles. As the universe expanded and cooled, these particles combined to form neutral hydrogen atoms. This process, called recombination, allowed light to travel freely through space for the first time, creating the CMB.

#### Discovery of the CMB

The CMB was discovered accidentally in 1964 by two radio astronomers, Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson. They were working on a radio telescope and found a mysterious noise that came from all directions in the sky. This noise turned out to be the CMB, confirming predictions made by earlier scientists and providing strong evidence for the Big Bang theory. The CMB is essentially a snapshot of the early universe, capturing its conditions and evolution over time.
