### Coding Challenge: Plotting Blackbody Radiation and Annotating Peak Wavelengths

Now, let's plot the blackbody radiation curves for different temperatures using the Planck's Law function you previously implemented. Additionally, you will annotate the peak wavelength calculated using Wien's Law on the plot.
