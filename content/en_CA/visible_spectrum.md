#### The Visible Light Spectrum

The visible light spectrum is the range of electromagnetic waves that can be detected by the human eye. It includes all the colours we see in a rainbow, from violet to red. Each colour corresponds to a specific range of wavelengths.

Let's zoom in on the blackbody radiation spectrum to see how the different colours fit within the electromagnetic spectrum. This will help us understand the relationship between temperature and the colour of light emitted by objects.
