# Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) Workshop

Authors: Louis Branch and Yilun Guan

## Activity Overview

In this workshop, you will learn about the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and its significance in cosmology. You'll start by understanding some basic physics concepts, like blackbody radiation and Wien's Law. Then, you'll explore how scientists study the CMB using real data from space missions. You'll also get hands-on experience with Python programming to analyze and visualize this data.

By the end of this workshop, you'll have a better understanding of the early universe and the tools scientists use to study it. Let's get started!
