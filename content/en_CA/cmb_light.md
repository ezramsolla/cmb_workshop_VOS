### Calculating the Distance the CMB Light Has Traveled

Now that we have measured the approximate angular radius of the CMB hot spot on the sky, and we know that these hot spots correspond to a physical size of around 150 megaparsecs (Mpc), we can calculate the distance that the CMB light has traveled from its source to us.

**1. Calculate the Distance:**

Use the measured angular size to calculate the distance that CMB light has traveled:

$$\text{distance} = \frac{\text{physical size}}{\text{angular size in radians}}$$

Find the distance using the formula above. Remember to convert the angular size from degrees to radians. You can use the formula below or `np.deg2rad` function.

$$\text{angular size (radians)} = \text{angular size (degrees)} \times \frac{\pi}{180}$$

**2. Calculate the Travel Time:**

Calculate how long it takes for light to traverse this distance. Use the speed of light in Mpc/year.

$$\text{time} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed of light}}$$
