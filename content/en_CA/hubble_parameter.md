Now that you have calculated the travel time of the CMB light, let's compare it with the current estimate of the age of the universe from reputable sources like NASA. This will help you understand the potential discrepancies and their reasons.

**Research Task:** Find the current estimate of the age of the universe from a reputable source like NASA. Compare your calculated time with the researched value. Consider the following points:

- Why might there be a discrepancy between your calculated value and the accepted age of the universe?
- The expansion of the universe affects the travel time of light, and this expansion rate is encoded in the Hubble Constant ($H_0$).

#### Understanding the Hubble Constant ($H_0$)

The Hubble Constant ($H_0$) measures the rate at which the universe is expanding. It is usually expressed in kilometers per second per megaparsec (km/s/Mpc). Accurately determining $H_0$ is crucial because it impacts our calculations of the universe's age and the travel time of light over vast distances.

Use the interactive widget below to find the value of $H_0$ that gives an age of the universe closest to the value you found during your research.
