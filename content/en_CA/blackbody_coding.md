### Coding Challenge: Blackbody Radiation Plot

**Instructions:**

1. Define Wavelengths: Use `np.linspace(start, end, num)` to create an array of wavelengths (in meters).
2. Select Temperatures: Choose temperatures (in Kelvin) for different objects or scenarios you want to explore (e.g., Sun, Sirius A, etc).
3. Calculate Spectral Radiance: Implement the blackbody_radiation function using Planck's Law to compute spectral radiance values for each temperature and wavelength range.
4. Plot Your Results: Write Python code to plot the spectral radiance curves for the chosen temperatures. Remember to label your axes appropriately and include a legend to differentiate between temperatures.
