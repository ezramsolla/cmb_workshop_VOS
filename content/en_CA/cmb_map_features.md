Overall, we can observe several types of features within the CMB map:

1. **Hot Spots/Cold Spots**:
   These regions show variations in temperature due to small differences in the amount of matter in different areas of the early universe. These tiny variations eventually grew over billions of years into the galaxies and other structures we see today.

2. **Stars**:
   While observing the CMB map, you may notice small point-like features that resemble stars. These are stars within our galaxy that become visible by blocking the CMB light.

3. **Galaxies**:
   The CMB map also contains signals from distant galaxies, typically observed as extended patches or structures embedded within the map.

4. **Galaxy Clusters**:
   Galaxy clusters are large assemblies of galaxies and dark matter pulled together by gravitational force. They appear as distinctive cold dot-like spots on the CMB map due to the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect. As the CMB radiation passes through the hot gas in galaxy clusters, it gets an energetic kick, shifting the radiation to a slightly different frequency, making these photons "missing" from the CMB map.

5. **Milky Way Galaxy**:
   The Milky Way emits various forms of radiation that can contaminate the CMB signal. It appears as a prominent feature, sometimes referred to as the "Galactic Plane," spanning across the CMB map. It's essential to account for and mitigate the Milky Way's contributions when studying the CMB.

### Formation of Hot and Cold Spots in the CMB

The hot and cold spots in the CMB map formed because of a tug-of-war between two forces in the early universe: the push of light (radiation pressure) and the pull of gravity. 

Hereâ€™s a simpler explanation:

1. **Tiny Differences**:
   At the very beginning, there were tiny differences in how matter was spread out in the universe. Some areas had a bit more matter, while others had a bit less.

2. **Push and Pull**:
   Light (radiation pressure) pushed outwards, while gravity pulled matter together. This push and pull created waves, like sound waves moving through the air.

3. **Frozen Waves**:
   About 400,000 years after the Big Bang, the universe cooled down enough that these waves stopped moving. The size of these "frozen" waves is about 500 million light-years across.

These frozen waves are what we see today as the hot and cold spots in the CMB map.
