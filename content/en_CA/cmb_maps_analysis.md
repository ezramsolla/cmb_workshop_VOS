When we visualize a three-dimensional object like a sphere on a two-dimensional surface, such as an image, distortions occur at the top and bottom. These distortions arise due to the challenge of representing a curved surface on a flat plane.

One interesting aspect of the CMB map is the temperature fluctuations across the sky. These fluctuations, although they seem random, provide valuable insights into the early universe.

To begin our analysis, let's get a sense of how much the CMB temperature fluctuates by measuring the standard deviation of the CMB map visually.
