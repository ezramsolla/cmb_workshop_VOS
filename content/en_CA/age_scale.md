## Measuring the Age and Scale of the Universe Using the CMB

### Sound Horizon and Hot Spots

The hot and cold spots in the CMB map formed from "sound" waves created by the push and pull between light and gravity in the early universe. About 300,000 years after the Big Bang, the universe cooled down enough for light to travel freely. During this time, these sound waves moved through the early universe, creating a pattern with a consistent size.

This consistent size, called the "sound horizon," is about 500 million light-years across (150 megaparsecs). The sound horizon is the maximum distance these sound waves could travel before the light started traveling freely. A megaparsec (Mpc) is a unit of distance used by astronomers, which is equal to about 3.26 million light-years.

Understanding the sound horizon is important because it acts like a "standard ruler" for distances in the universe. This means we can use it to measure how far away things are in space. By looking at the size of the hot and cold spots in the CMB map, we can learn a lot about the universe, including its age and how fast it's expanding. The expansion rate tells us how fast the universe is growing over time.

In the next sections, we will:
1. Identify hot spots in the CMB map.
2. Average the hot spot images to reduce noise and see the pattern more clearly. "Noise" is unwanted random data, while "signal" is the important data we want to measure. Improving the signal-to-noise ratio (SN) helps us see the patterns more clearly.
3. Measure the size of the averaged hot spot.
4. Calculate the distance the CMB light has traveled using this size.
5. Determine the time it took for this light to reach us, helping us estimate the age of the universe.

By following these steps, we can use the CMB data to understand the scale and age of the universe better.
