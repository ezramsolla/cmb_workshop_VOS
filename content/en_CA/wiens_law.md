### Peak Wavelength and Wien's Law

After exploring the blackbody radiation curves, you've seen how the peak of the radiation curve shifts with changes in temperature. This movement isn't random; it's described by Wien's Displacement Law. Wien's Law tells us the wavelength at which the radiation from a blackbody (like a star, including our Sun) is most intense, and this wavelength is inversely related to the temperature of the body.

Wien's Law can be stated mathematically as:

$\lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{b}{T}$

where:
- $\lambda_{\text{max}}$ is the peak wavelength — the wavelength at which the emission is strongest,
- $T$ is the absolute temperature of the blackbody (in Kelvin),
- $b$ is Wien's displacement constant, approximately $2.897 \times 10^{-3}$ m·K (meter-Kelvin).

This law reveals an important insight: as a blackbody gets hotter, its peak emission shifts to shorter wavelengths. This is why, for example, a heating metal glows red and then white as its temperature increases.

#### Practical Implication

In astronomy, Wien's Law enables us to determine the surface temperature of stars by observing the color of the light they emit. A star emitting peak radiation at shorter wavelengths (more towards the blue end of the spectrum) is hotter than a star emitting peak radiation at longer wavelengths (more towards the red end of the spectrum).

#### Optional Challenge: Implementing Wien's Law

Let’s implement Wien's Law to calculate the peak wavelength for a given temperature.
