### Measuring the Angular Size of Hot Spots

After averaging the thumbnails, the next step is to measure the angular size of the averaged hot spot. This measurement helps estimate the distance that CMB light has traveled.

**Horizontal Slice Analysis**:

Use the slider to adjust the percentage threshold. Observe the shaded area on the profile plot and the corresponding dashed line on the averaged hot spot image. Set the slider to 30% to identify the pixel range where the temperature fluctuation drops to 30% of its peak value.
