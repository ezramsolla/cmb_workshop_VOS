**Radial Profile Analysis:**

Switch to the radial profile plot to get a more accurate measurement. Adjust the percentage threshold using the slider. Observe the shaded area and the corresponding dashed circle on the averaged hot spot image. Set the slider to 30% to identify the radius where the temperature fluctuation drops to 30% of its peak value.

Notice how the radial profile provides a tighter and more precise fit compared to the horizontal slice, offering a better measurement of the angular size.
