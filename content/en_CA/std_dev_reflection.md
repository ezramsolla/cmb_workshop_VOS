#### Think and Reflect

1. How small are the fluctuations compared to the average CMB temperature of 2.7 K?
2. How many times smaller are the fluctuations than the mean CMB temperature?
3. Why are these temperature fluctuations interesting?

The CMB map is remarkably uniform, with fluctuations roughly a hundred-thousand times smaller than the mean temperature. Measuring these tiny fluctuations is a significant achievement, as they represent minute density variations in the early universe, which are the seeds of the structures we see today.
