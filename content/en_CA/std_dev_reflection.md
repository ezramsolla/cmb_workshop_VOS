#### Think and Reflect

1. How small are the fluctuations compared to the average CMB temperature of 2.7 K?
2. How many times smaller are the fluctuations than the mean CMB temperature?
3. Why are these temperature fluctuations interesting?

The CMB map is remarkably uniform, meaning that its temperature is almost the same in every direction we look. However, there are tiny fluctuations in this temperature, roughly a hundred-thousand times smaller than the mean temperature. Measuring these tiny fluctuations is a significant achievement, as they represent minute density variations in the early universe, which are the seeds of the structures we see today.
