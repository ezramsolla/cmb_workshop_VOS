### Measuring Standard Deviation

Standard deviation is a statistical measure that quantifies the amount of variation or dispersion in a set of values. In the context of the CMB, it helps us understand how much the temperature fluctuates across different parts of the sky. A lower standard deviation means the values are closer to the mean (average), while a higher standard deviation means the values are more spread out.

To measure the standard deviation visually, we look for the range within which most data points fall. This range is typically centered around the mean value, with the standard deviation $\sigma$ indicating the typical distance from the mean.
