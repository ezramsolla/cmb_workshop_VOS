This theoretical construct, known as a \"black body,\" absorbs all incident electromagnetic radiation, regardless of frequency or angle, and re-emits it in a characteristic spectrum that depends only on the body's temperature. This phenomenon is critical in various fields, including astrophysics, where it helps in understanding celestial objects' thermal properties and the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB).\n",

    "\n",
    "After exploring the black body radiation curves, you've seen how the peak of the radiation curve shifts with changes in temperature. This movement isn't random; it's described by Wien's Displacement Law. Wien's Law tells us the wavelength at which the radiation from a black body (like a star, including our Sun) is most intense, and this wavelength is inversely related to the temperature of the body.\n",
