This theoretical construct, known as a \"black body,\" absorbs all incident electromagnetic radiation, regardless of frequency or angle, and re-emits it in a characteristic spectrum that depends only on the body's temperature. This phenomenon is critical in various fields, including astrophysics, where it helps in understanding celestial objects' thermal properties and the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB).\n",

    "\n",
    "After exploring the black body radiation curves, you've seen how the peak of the radiation curve shifts with changes in temperature. This movement isn't random; it's described by Wien's Displacement Law. Wien's Law tells us the wavelength at which the radiation from a black body (like a star, including our Sun) is most intense, and this wavelength is inversely related to the temperature of the body.\n",
    "\n",

    "$\\lambda_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{b}{T}$\n",

    "- $\\lambda_{\\text{max}}$ is the peak wavelength — the wavelength at which the emission is strongest,\n",
    "- $T$ is the absolute temperature of the black body (in Kelvin),\n",
    "- $b$ is Wien's displacement constant, approximately $2.897 \\times 10^{-3}$ m·K (meter-Kelvin).\n",
    "\n",
    "This law reveals an important insight: as a black body gets hotter, its peak emission shifts to shorter wavelengths. This is why, for example, a heating metal glows red and then white as its temperature increases.\n",

    "#### Practical Implication\n",

    "\n",
    "According to the Big Bang Theory:\n",
    "\n",
    "The universe started as a hot and dense plasma consisting mainly of protons, electrons, neutrons, and photons(light). These free electrons strongly scattered photons, preventing them from traveling freely through space.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a similar to shining a flashlight in a dense fog, the light will shine for a short distance before it is scattered by the fog.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the Universe expanded and cooled enough at around 3000K when the universe was approximately 379,000 years old, the free electrons and protons combined to form neutral hydrogen atoms. This is known as the peroid of Recombination. It was at this time that the Universe became transparent. In other words the fog dissapated.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CMB is essentially the \"snapshot\" of the universe at the time of recombination. The CMB are the first photons emitted from the Universe during recombination that were able to travel freely.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CMB is therefore a black-body spectrum of this afterglow!\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the expansion of the universe however over Billions of years, the CMB light is redshifted (streched out).\n",
    "\n",
    "### How it was Discovered!\n",
    "\n",
    "The existence of the CMB radiation was first predicted by Ralph Alpherin, Robert Herman, and George Gamow 1948. They reasoned that if the Big Bang had happend, the high energy background radiation would have been stretched into the microwave range of light. It was initally predicted to be ~5k.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first measurement of the CMB was by Andrew McKellar in 1941 at measured an effective temperature of 2.3 K - at the time Mckeller did not associate his measurement with the CMB. Because of this credit is typically given to Arno Allan Penzias and Robert Woodrow Wilson for their 1964 measurements at around 3K.\n",
    "\n",
    "Penzias, and Wilson where working at a sensitive radio telescope for Bell Labs. They stumbled upon the CMB as an unknown noise artifact noise that they could not figure out how to eliminate from their data. This unknown noise artifact was evenly spread over the sky, and was present both at day time and night. They concluded it must come from outside the galaxy, it was by fluke of circumstances that they ran into Robert H. Dicke, Jim Peebles, and David Wilkinson Cosmologists who were about to search for the CMB; after a talk they published their paper jointly to avoid conflict.\n",

    "The isotropic behavior of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) played a crucial role in motivating the concept of cosmic inflation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Isotropic\" refers to a property or characteristic that remains the same in all directions. In the context of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, isotropy implies that the radiation appears uniform and exhibits the same properties regardless of the direction in which it is observed. This means that the CMB radiation has a consistent temperature and intensity when measured from different points in the sky. The isotropic nature of the CMB is a fundamental observation in cosmology and provides important insights into the early universe and its evolution.\n",

The inflationary epoch is believed to have lasted from $10^{−36}$ seconds to between $10^{−33}$ and $10^{-32}$ seconds after the Big Bang. This rapid expansion would explain why the CMB is highly isotropic."

    "**Exercise: see if you can identify different types of objects in the map**\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, we can observe several types of features within the CMB map.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Hot Spots/Cold Spots:\n",
    "First we notice the regions of both hot and cold spots. These temperature variations arise from the density fluctuations in the early universe. These fluctuations are remnants of the quantum fluctuations during the cosmic inflation era, which have evolved over billions of years into the structures we see today.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Stars:\n",
    "While observing the CMB map, we may come across small point-like features that resemble stars. In fact, many of them are stars in our galaxy and they become visible by blocking the CMB light.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Galaxies:\n",
    "The CMB map also contains signals from distant galaxies. These signals are typically observed as extended patches or structures embedded within the CMB map.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Galaxy Clusters:\n",
    "Another fascinating feature that can be observed in the CMB map is galaxy clusters which are a huge assembly of galaxies and dark matter pulled together by gravitational force. They manifest as distinctive cold dot-like spots in the CMB map. This intriguing characteristic arises due to an effect known as Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect. As the CMB radiation passes through the hot gas present within galaxy clusters, it gets a energetic kick which shifts the CMB radiations to a slightly different frequency, and consequently, these photons are \"missing\" from the CMB map, appearing as cold spots.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Milky Way Galaxy:\n",
    "In the CMB map, we may also notice a large, prominent feature that corresponds to our own Milky Way galaxy. The Milky Way emits various forms of radiation that can contaminate the CMB signal. It appears as a distinctive pattern, sometimes referred to as the \"Galactic Plane,\" spanning across the CMB map. Care must be taken to account for and mitigate the Milky Way's contributions when studying the cosmic microwave background.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formation of cold and hot spots in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) map can be attributed to the interplay between radiation pressure and gravity during the early universe. Slight density variations caused variations in radiation pressure, leading to sound waves propagating through the gas. At around 400,000 years after the Big Bang, the interaction between matter and radiation significantly reduces, resulting in the pressure wave being nearly frozen, with a size of approximately 150 megaparsecs.\n"

    "### Estimate the distance of the moon\n",
    "\n",
    "To estimate the age of the universe using the CMB map, we can employ a methodology similar to determining the distance of the moon. Let's walk through how to do that now.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's suppose that we already know the physical size (diameter) of the moon to be 3,474 km, and we can easily measure the angular size (diameter) of the moon on the sky to be 0.52 deg. How do we estimate the distance of moon to us? Recall the formula for an arc-length\n",

    "In the context of the CMB, the hot and cold spots are a result of primordial \"sound\" waves generated by the interplay of gravity and radiation pressure. At approximately 300,000 years after the Big Bang, the CMB light becomes independent from the other primordial components of the universe. During this relatively brief period, the primordial \"sound\" waves have only 300,000 years to propagate, leading to the formation of a pattern with a consistent physical size, determined by the sound speed. This physical size constraint is referred to as the \"sound horizon\" and is calculated to be approximately 150 Mpc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having established the sound horizon's physical size, our next step is to measure the apparent size of each hot spot in the CMB maps. By doing so, we can then estimate the distance the CMB light has traversed to reach us. With the known speed of light, we can calculate the time it took for the light to reach us, providing a close approximation of the age of the universe.\n",
