## Measuring the Age and Scale of the Universe Using the CMB

### Sound Horizon and Hot Spots

In the context of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), the hot and cold spots are a result of primordial "sound" waves generated by the interplay of gravity and radiation pressure. At approximately 300,000 years after the Big Bang, the CMB light decoupled from other primordial components of the universe. During this relatively brief period, the primordial "sound" waves propagated through the early universe, creating a pattern with a consistent physical size, determined by the speed of sound in the early universe.

This consistent physical size is known as the "sound horizon," which is approximately 150 megaparsecs (Mpc). The sound horizon represents the maximum distance that these sound waves could travel in the early universe before the CMB light decoupled and began to travel freely through space.

Understanding the sound horizon is crucial because it provides a standard ruler for measuring distances in the universe. By observing the size of the hot and cold spots in the CMB map, we can infer significant cosmological parameters, including the age and expansion rate of the universe.

In the next sections, we will:
1. Identify hot spots in the CMB map.
2. Average the hot spot thumbnails to reduce noise.
3. Measure the angular size of the averaged hot spot.
4. Calculate the distance the CMB light has traveled using this angular size.
5. Determine the time it took for this light to reach us, providing an estimate of the age of the universe.
