### Identifying Hot Spots in the CMB Map

To understand the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and the sound horizon, we need to identify the hot spots in the CMB map. These hot spots are regions where the temperature is slightly higher than the average, resulting from density fluctuations in the early universe.

Instructions:

- Use the Visualizer: Open the CMB map visualizer provided below.
- Identify Hot Spots: Locate at least 20 hot spots on the map. Remember to avoid regions with obvious galaxies or stars.
- Record Coordinates: Write down the coordinates (latitude and longitude) of each hot spot you identify in the array provided. The coordinates appear on the map on the left bottom corner in the format of `lat : long : temperature variation`.
- Visualize Thumbnails: Use the provided code to extract and visualize the thumbnails of the identified hot spots.
