### Let's Play with CMB Maps

Now that we have learned the basics of the CMB, it's time to dive into the exciting world of real CMB maps. These maps provide us with invaluable insights into the early universe and its properties. Let's explore this fascinating field together!

The Planck mission was a space observatory dedicated to studying the CMB. Launched by the European Space Agency (ESA) in 2009, Planck collected data until 2013, revolutionizing our understanding of the universe's origins.

#### Loading Measurements from Planck

To work with Planck data, we use special software tools designed to handle and analyze CMB data. These tools simplify accessing and interpreting the information contained within Planck's measurements. We have pre-downloaded some Planck maps for you.

Let's load these maps and visualize them using the provided functions.
