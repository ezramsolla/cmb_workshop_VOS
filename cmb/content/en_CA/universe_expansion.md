## Expansion of the Universe

### The Doppler Effect

The Doppler effect is a phenomenon that occurs when there is relative motion between a source of waves and an observer. You may have noticed it with sound: for example, the siren of an ambulance sounds higher-pitched as it approaches you and lower-pitched as it moves away. This change in pitch happens because the sound waves are compressed as the ambulance approaches and stretched as it moves away.

<figcaption>The figure shows a moving ambulence, its moving to the right. The sound waves from the siren are compressed in the direction of travel, and streched in the direction the ambulence is leaving. <a href="https://online-learning-college.com/knowledge-hub/gcses/gcse-physics-help/doppler-effect/">Source.</a></figcaption>

### Redshift and the Expanding Universe

The Doppler effect also applies to light waves. When a light source moves away from us, its light waves are stretched, making the light appear redder. This is called redshift. Conversely, if a light source moves toward us, its light waves are compressed, making the light appear bluer, which is called blueshift.

Redshift is a key piece of evidence for the expanding universe. By observing the redshift of light from distant galaxies, scientists have concluded that the universe is expanding. The further away a galaxy is, the faster it appears to be moving away from us, indicating that space itself is stretching.

##### Visualizing Redshift

Let's look at how redshift works with an interactive plot.
