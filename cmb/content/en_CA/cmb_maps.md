### CMB Maps

A CMB (Cosmic Microwave Background) map is a visual representation of the temperature fluctuations in the CMB radiation across the sky. These tiny variations in temperature are remnants of the early universe, providing a snapshot of the conditions shortly after the Big Bang. By studying these maps, scientists can learn about the universe's composition, structure, and evolution.

The image below shows the progression of CMB maps from COBE, WMAP, and Planck missions. Each successive mission has provided more detailed and accurate maps, helping scientists gain deeper insights into the early universe.

Each panel showcases 10-square-degree patches of all-sky maps captured by space-based missions that have revolutionized our understanding of the universe. The left panel introduces NASA's Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE), launched in 1989, which played a pivotal role in supporting the big bang theory and revealing crucial information about the ancient state of our universe. In the middle panel, we encounter the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP), launched in 2001, which unraveled intricate variations in the primordial light, offering strong evidence for inflation and refining our understanding of the cosmos. Finally, on the right panel, we are introduced to Planck, the most advanced satellite to date, launched in 2009 with contributions from NASA and the European Space Agency.

### Let's Play with CMB Maps

Now that we have learned the basics of the CMB, it's time to dive into the exciting world of real CMB maps. These maps provide us with invaluable insights into the early universe and its properties. Let's explore this fascinating field together!

The Planck mission was a space observatory dedicated to studying the CMB. Launched by the European Space Agency (ESA) in 2009, Planck collected data until 2013, revolutionizing our understanding of the universe's origins.

#### Loading Measurements from Planck

To work with Planck data, we use special software tools designed to handle and analyze CMB data. These tools simplify accessing and interpreting the information contained within Planck's measurements. We have pre-downloaded some Planck maps for you.

Let's load these maps and visualize them using the provided functions.
