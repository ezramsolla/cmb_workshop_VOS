### Averaging Hot Spot Thumbnails

Now that you have identified hot spots in the CMB map, the next step is to average these thumbnails. Averaging reduces noise and provides a clearer view of temperature fluctuation patterns.

Use the slider to adjust the number of thumbnails included in the averaging process. Observe how the mean thumbnail improves as more hot spots are added, reducing noise and clarifying the signal.

Notice how the noise reduces and the signal becomes clearer as more hot spots are averaged. If the averaged image does not look correct, check the coordinates and thumbnails you used. You might need to re-evaluate the hot spots and adjust the coordinates accordingly.
