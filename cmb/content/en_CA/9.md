## Analyzing COBE Data Spectrum

The Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) was a satellite launched by NASA in 1989 to measure the diffuse infrared and microwave radiation from the early universe. One of its key discoveries was the detailed measurement of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation, which closely matches the spectrum of a perfect blackbody.

In this activity, you'll use real data from the COBE mission. By adjusting the temperature of a blackbody radiation curve, you can see how well it fits the actual measurements. The goal is to find the temperature that best matches the COBE data points.
