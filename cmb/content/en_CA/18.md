Overall, we can observe several types of features within the CMB map:

1. **Hot Spots/Cold Spots**:
   These regions show variations in temperature due to density fluctuations in the early universe. These fluctuations are remnants of quantum fluctuations from the cosmic inflation era, which have evolved over billions of years into the structures we see today.

2. **Stars**:
   While observing the CMB map, you may notice small point-like features that resemble stars. These are stars within our galaxy that become visible by blocking the CMB light.

3. **Galaxies**:
   The CMB map also contains signals from distant galaxies, typically observed as extended patches or structures embedded within the map.

4. **Galaxy Clusters**:
   Galaxy clusters are large assemblies of galaxies and dark matter pulled together by gravitational force. They appear as distinctive cold dot-like spots on the CMB map due to the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect. As the CMB radiation passes through the hot gas in galaxy clusters, it gets an energetic kick, shifting the radiation to a slightly different frequency, making these photons "missing" from the CMB map.

5. **Milky Way Galaxy**:
   The Milky Way emits various forms of radiation that can contaminate the CMB signal. It appears as a prominent feature, sometimes referred to as the "Galactic Plane," spanning across the CMB map. It's essential to account for and mitigate the Milky Way's contributions when studying the CMB.

The formation of hot and cold spots in the CMB map can be attributed to the interplay between radiation pressure and gravity during the early universe. Slight density variations caused fluctuations in radiation pressure, leading to sound waves propagating through the gas. At around 400,000 years after the Big Bang, the interaction between matter and radiation significantly reduced, resulting in the pressure wave being nearly frozen, with a size of approximately 150 megaparsecs.
