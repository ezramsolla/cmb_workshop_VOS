## Introduction

### The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)

The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) is the afterglow of the Big Bang, the event that created our universe around 13.8 billion years ago. This faint glow fills the entire sky and is one of the most important pieces of evidence for the Big Bang theory. It tells us about the early universe when it was just a hot, dense soup of particles.

#### What is the CMB?

The CMB is a form of electromagnetic radiation, just like visible light, but it is in the microwave part of the spectrum. It was created when the universe was only 379,000 years old and has been traveling through space ever since. By studying the CMB, scientists can learn about the conditions of the early universe and how it has evolved over time.

#### Formation of the CMB

In the early universe, everything was so hot that atoms couldn't exist; protons and electrons were separate particles. As the universe expanded and cooled, these particles combined to form neutral hydrogen atoms. This process, called recombination, allowed light to travel freely through space for the first time, creating the CMB.

#### Discovery of the CMB

The CMB was discovered accidentally in 1964 by two radio astronomers, Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson. They were working on a radio telescope and found a mysterious noise that came from all directions in the sky. This noise turned out to be the CMB, confirming predictions made by earlier scientists and providing strong evidence for the Big Bang theory.
